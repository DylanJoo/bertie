This repo is made for adopting NLP model training process to TPU instances.
And mainly focus on streamline the data pipeline via `tf.data` with TFRecord.


## Installation
```
transformers
datasets
tensorflow
```

## The pipeline and components
1. TPU authentication
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model training

## Example
The following code is the simple demo.
```python

```
